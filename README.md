Jekyll cheat site: <http://cirosantilli.github.io/jekyll-cheat/>

Quickstart:

    bundle install
    bundle exec jekyll serve --watch &
    firefox localhost:4000

Pages will be rebuilt on save.

#TODO

This is a list of features which I think are missing and will consider implementing for the sake of elearning:

- server side TOC
- server side math / equations.
- export each page separately to PDF.
